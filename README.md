My simple but awesome conky configuration. Feel free to fork and use it yourself.

### Google Calendar Conky

I recently created a conky to display the events from Google Calendar as well.

You need to be familiar with python and virtual environments to run it properly. I will soon write a setup wiki for the same. Have a look at `get_calendar.py` and `google_calendar.config` for code logic and configuration.

<div style="float:left;width:100%">
<img alt=conky-core  src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madhur/awesome-conky/master/screenshots/google_calendar.png />
</div>
<div style="float:clear"></div>
<p/><p/><p/>

### Usage
Just drop the filels into conky configuration directory i.e. `~/config/.conky/`
